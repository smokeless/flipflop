What is flipflop?
	It's a just a simple python script for a random hostname/mac address.

What do I need to do to run this?
Install Python

Install macchanger

Be running systemd for hostnamectl

Edit flipflop script to point at your wordlist eg: /usr/share/dict/ry.txt

Read the code, it's not very long, but you're going to be running
it as root so you should probably read it.
